# Download Web

--------------------------------

This is an MVC application that allows users to upload and download content with ease.  If you need a streamlined site that makes it easy for admins to post content and members to download it, look no further.


This application allows for three roles, an admin with complete control over the site, they can post files to download (.exe's, installers, ReadMe's, and other added files with descriptions) with extreme flexibility, and also choose if the files are public for anyone to download, or private for only the users the admins allow to download.  Members are allowed to download private content, but can't post, and can't change the role of other users.  Non-Validated Members have the same permissions as an autonomous user, which is only the ability to download content marked public. (NOTE: The default role when a user registers for the site is a non-validated member)


The users that come to the site can find what they are looking for via search, or they can browse all available files page by page, complete with older archived versions.
